      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Umar Adam Umar, a passionate and dedicated Software Engineering student currently in my third year at Northwest University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I completed my secondary education in <strong>2019</strong>, where I developed a strong interest in technology and problem-solving. This early passion led me to pursue a degree in <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, where I'm now gaining hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying real-world applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve worked on several academic and personal projects involving web development, mobile apps, and software systems. I continue to grow by learning new tools and technologies and enjoy building solutions that are both functional and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continue my journey, I’m eager to explore opportunities to apply my skills, collaborate with others, and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.
